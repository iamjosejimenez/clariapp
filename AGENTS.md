# Codex Rules

These rules apply to every question in this repository.

1. Always provide the direct answer first, then include only the minimum necessary implementation details.
2. If code changes are requested, make the changes in files and summarize what changed with exact file paths.
3. Do not guess about behavior or requirements; state assumptions explicitly when information is missing.
4. Prefer safe, non-destructive commands and avoid operations that can lose data unless explicitly requested.
5. All user-facing text in the solution must be written in Spanish.
6. All atributes of a model should be mandatory unless business rules allow for optional values.
